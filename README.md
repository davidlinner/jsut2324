# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

To get started follow the steps below:

**Step 1)** Install dependencies

In China you may want to setup an npm mirror first with:

    npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com

then run 

    npm install

**Step 2)** Start the dev server

    npm run dev

Then follow the instructions on the terminal and, for example, open `http://localhost:5173/` in your Web Browser (e.g. Edge)
